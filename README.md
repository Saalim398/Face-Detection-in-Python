# Face Detection System 

Version `1.0`   
 
Face detection Softwares are used everywhere, so I tried to create one in python using openCV library.  
This model basically uses `cascadeclassifier` to detect faces, objects etc.   
You can install this software on your device by following the below steps:
1. Python should be installed in your system
2. Run the following command in terminal
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Saalim398/Face-Detection-in-Python.git
   ```
   download the zip file it contains images
   for real time face detection run
   ```
   python face_detection.py
   ```
   for zip files run
   ```
   python face_detection_opencv.py
   ```
